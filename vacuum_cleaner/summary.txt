	t0 scan the input_protect_pin, if it get a logic low signal, then
enter the charge_protect procedure.

discharge_protect
	t0 scan the output_protect_pin, if get a logic low signal, then
it trigger the discharge_protect procedure.

bat_is_low
	while system works, if detect the battery voltage is lower than the preset
value, then let the led flash in orderly

I97, bat_protect_board let battery votage down to 2.6v
so you must recover the voltage where charge
